# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis-05-2024
This repository contains Python scripts and analyses from the Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis project. Acting as an analyst for Instacart, I delved into their sales data to uncover hidden patterns. The project explored customer purchasing behaviours and derived insights to inform targeted marketing strategies. The primary goal of this project is to refine Instacart’s market segmentation strategies by conducting a thorough exploratory analysis using Python. 
# Instacart Data Analysis Project
# Objectives 
In this project, I aim to: 
1. Identify peak order times and days to help schedule ads during less busy periods.
2. Determine times when customers spend the most money to inform targeted product advertisements. 
3. Simplify product price range groupings to streamline marketing efforts. 
4. Identify the most popular product departments to understand departmental order frequency. 5. Explore customer demographics and purchasing behaviours to create targeted marketing campaigns.
# Context
Instacart, an established online grocery platform, seeks to refine its marketing efforts. The company believes that a one-size-fits-all approach isn't optimal. My analysis aims to segment customers effectively and propose targeted strategies to enhance product sales. 
# Key Questions Addressed
1. What are the peak order times and days?
2. When do customers tend to spend the most? 
3. How can product price ranges improve marketing strategies? 
4. Which product departments are most popular? 
5. How do customer demographics and behaviours regarding brand loyalty, regional differences, and purchasing patterns vary?
# Data Source 
The project leverages open-source datasets from Instacart, complemented by specially created customer datasets. These resources are integral to addressing the outlined business questions.

# Data Sets
1. Orders
2. Orders_products_prior
3. Products
4. Departments
5. Customers
The customer dataset, as well as the "prices" column in the products dataset, were fabricated as additions to the original dataset specifically for learning purposes of the CareerFoundry  data analytics course.
# Methodology 
# Data Collection
•	Utilized open-source data sets from Instacart and a custom customer data set for analysis. 
# Data Preparation
1. Cleaned and pre-processed the data to handle missing values, duplicates, and mixed data types.
2. Merged multiple datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. 
# Data Analysis
1. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in customer purchasing behaviour.
2. Performed data visualization to communicate insights clearly and effectively.
3. Used Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy for analysis and visualization. 
# Key Insights 
1. Order Patterns: Identified peak ordering days and times, and high-spending periods. 
2. Product Popularity: Analysed product orders by department to determine the most frequently purchased items. 
3. Customer Segmentation: Profiled customers based on demographics, loyalty, and purchasing behaviour to inform targeted marketing strategies.
# Stakeholders 
The insights derived from this analysis will cater to: 
1. Vice President of Marketing: Improve targeting for ad campaigns. 
2. Senior Vice President of Sales: Identify and boost underperforming sectors.
3. Instacart Customers: Receive relevant ads, promotions, and recommendations.
# Project Structure/Folders
1. Data/: Separated into two subfolders containing the original (raw) datasets and the prepared (data frames after cleaning and merging multiple datasets to create a comprehensive data frame) dataset used for analysis.
2. Project Management/: Includes project brief and data dictionary.
3. Scripts/: Jupyter notebooks documenting the coding for the analysis process and key findings. Includes Python scripts for data cleaning, merging, analysis, and visualization.
4. Sent to Client/: Final report summarizing the analysis, insights, and recommendations for Instacart stakeholders.
5. Analysis/: Data visualizations generated during the analysis and used for explaining insights. 
# Usage 
# Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6 or higher (ipykernel)
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Anaconda distribution (recommended for package management)
