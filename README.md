# Instacart-Grocery-Basket-Analysis-05-2024
This repository contains Python scripts and analyses from the Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis project. Acting as an analyst for Instacart, I delved into their sales data to uncover hidden patterns. The project involved exploring customer purchasing behaviours and deriving insights to inform targeted marketing strategies. The primary goal of this project is to refine Instacartâ€™s market segmentation strategies by conducting thorough exploratory analysis using Python.
